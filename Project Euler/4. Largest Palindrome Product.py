Title: Largest Palindrome Product
Problem Statement:
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# This snippet is a solution to the problem 4 of Project Euler. The problem is about finding the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. The solution is to iterate over all the possible products of two 3-digit numbers and check if the product is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, then update the answer with the maximum of the current product and the answer. Finally, return the answer. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of digits in the input number. The space complexity is O(1).

# The solution is correct and passes all the test cases.
